## Hello

I'm a software architect, sailor and marine science advocate.
I've been working in AI, software development and data analysis primarily as a consultant for decades.
I'm a graduate student in UNE's Climate Change Leadership program.

**Where the Land Meets the Tide**
The fisherman mends his nets at dawn,
salt-worn hands know what the old ones knew—
read the water, watch the wind,
respect what feeds you.
His grandfather caught cod by the ton.
His father watched them disappear.
Now he tracks the shifting schools,
learns new waters year by year.
The whale breaches off the point,
ancient navigator of the blue,
carrying in her song the memory
of ice that once ran true.
The village adapts or fades—
higher docks, different catch,
kelp farms where the cod once spawned,
new knowledge born from scratch.
But this much holds against the change:
the covenant between the shore and sea,
the knowing that we're stitched together,
that their fate and ours can't be set free.
So we choose—to turn away or turn toward,
to let the waters rise unchecked,
or stand as stewards of this edge,
where ocean, land, and future intersect.
The nets are mended. The boats go out.
The whales still sing their ancient song.
And we—we choose if they'll have waters
worthy of them, all along.
